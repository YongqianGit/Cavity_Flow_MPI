# Cavity_Flow_MPI
2D cavity flow simulation developed with Fortran + MPI


## Description
2D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) case from Reynolds number 10 to 1000, developed using Fortran. To speed up computation, parallel computation library, MPI, is used.

This figure shows the contour of horizontal velocity and the 2D velocity
vectors (streamlines).
